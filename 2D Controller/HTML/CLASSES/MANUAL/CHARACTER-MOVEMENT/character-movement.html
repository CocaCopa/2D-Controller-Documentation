        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The <b>CharacterMovement</b> script is a versatile component designed to handle character movement within a Unity project.
            <br><br>
            To utilize the component in your Unity project, proceed by attaching the script to the <b>root</b> object of your character in the
            Unity Editor, and then configure the parameters exposed in the Inspector to customize the character's movement behaviour.
        </p>
