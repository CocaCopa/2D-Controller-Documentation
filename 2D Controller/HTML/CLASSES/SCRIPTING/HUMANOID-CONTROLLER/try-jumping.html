            <h2>Declaration</h2>
            <p>protected void <b>TryJumping</b>();</p> <br>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            Attempts to make the character jump based on certain conditions. <br> <br>
            
            When the designated jump key is pressed, a series of checks are conducted to ensure the feasibility of initiating a jump. These checks encompass factors such as 
            the remaining air jumps, if applicable, and considerations regarding the setup of Ledge Grab and/or Ledge Climb mechanics. For instance, if the jump key is pressed
            while your character is ledge grabbing, the system evaluates the percentage of the played ledge grab animation before permitting the jump. Said evaluation is
            based on the 'ledgeJumpThreshold' value, set in the inspector <br> <br>

            Furthermore, the execution of a jump varies based on the character's state, distinguishing between scenarios such as wall sliding, standard jumps from the 
            ground, or air jumps. <br> <br>
            
            Importantly, initiating a jump will also override any ongoing attack animation within the combat system, ensuring a seamless transition between actions.
