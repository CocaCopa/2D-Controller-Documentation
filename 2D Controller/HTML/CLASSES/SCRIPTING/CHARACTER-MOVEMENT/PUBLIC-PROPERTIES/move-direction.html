        <h2>Declaration</h2>
        <p>public float <b>MoveDirection</b> { get; set; }</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This property represents the direction your character is facing.
            <br> <br>
            It is important to note that the <b>CharacterMovement</b> class operates independently of external changes in your character's direction. In the
            event of a sudden shift in movement direction, it is crucial to manually adjust the <b>MoveDirection</b> property accordingly.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Unfortunately, providing a specific example demonstrating when and how to update the value of <b>MoveDirection</b> is not feasible here, as it requires a custom action
        to precede it. Instead of presenting an example in this context, please refer to the <b>CharacterDash_OnDashDistanceCovered</b> event listener in the
        <a class="redirect-link" href="../../HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/humanoid-controller.html">HumanoidController</a> script. Navigate to your project files: <br>
        <b>Assets -> 2D Character Controller -> _Scripts -> Character -> Controllers -> HumanoidController.cs</b>
        <br> <br>
        When the character executes a dash, the <b>MoveDirection</b> property is updated with the value of the character's right direction
        (<a class="redirect-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-right.html">transform.right</a>). This is done because it is possible for your
        character to jump, running toward the left direction, but the dash could be performed in the right direction and vice versa. This would result to your character
        travelling toward the right direction as expected, but as soon as the dash was completed, they would change their travel direction again, to the left direction.
        <br>Updating the value of the <b>MoveDirection</b> property accordingly, solves this issue.
