        <h2>Navigation Bar - Intended order</h2>
        <p>
            Follow the navigation bar from left to right to guide you through all the steps needed to create your own character using the asset. For
            your first walkthrough, it's best to read each page from start to finish to understand how to solve potential issues and how things work.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Guides - How to Make the Most of Them</h2>
        <p>
            Each guide in this documentation first explains what is going to be done, followed by images that further clarify the steps. For the best
            experience, read the section thoroughly, review the accompanying images, and then apply the steps in your project.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Classes - When to Refer to the "Manual"</h2>
        <p>
            Get familiar with the components by taking a look at their "Manual" page. Each exposed property is explained in terms of its function and
            usage, along with a short description of the component's overall purpose. Note that some fields, like component or transform references,
            may not be relevant since the asset includes a preconfigured "CharacterTemplate" prefab that already references those fields.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Classes - When to Refer to "Scripting"</h2>
        <p>
            Some public methods are integrated and managed internally within the asset. These methods are generally not relevant for users relying solely
            on the provided asset, but they are documented for those who wish to use these classes independently. The "Classes - Scripting" pages are
            mainly useful for viewing the available public properties and events to integrate your custom code with the asset.
            <br>
            Integrated methods are marked as "Internal Integration" while the rest are marked as "Direct Usage".
        </p>

        <h2>FAQ - Your Questions Might Already Be Answered</h2>
        <p>
            Reading the documentation step-by-step should help you set up a fully functional character. However, if you missed something or experience
            unintended behaviour or bugs, check the FAQ pageâ€”your question might already be answered there.
        </p>
