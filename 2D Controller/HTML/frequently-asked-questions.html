        <h2>Q: How can I set up a new character?</h2>
        <ul class="answer-division">

                To set up a new character, please consult the <a class="redirect-link" href="locomotion-controller.html">Locomotion System</a>
                page in the documentation. By following the outlined steps, you can create a fully functional base character to kickstart your
                project.

        <h2>Q: Why does the character need 2 colliders in order to function properly?</h2>
        <ul class="answer-division">
            <li class="answer-li">
                <b>A:</b>
            </li>
            <li class="answer-li">
                The character requires two colliders for optimal functionality, primarily due to the mechanics implemented in the Locomotion System.
                One collider <b>(Vertical)</b> is dedicated to the character's <b>main body collision detection</b>, while the second collider <b>(Horizontal)</b>
                is specifically utilized for the <b>floor slide mechanic</b>. The system dynamically toggles between these two colliders as needed, ensuring that
                each one is active only when required. This dynamic switching allows for precise control over collision detection, enabling the character to seamlessly
                interact with the environment.

                For more insight, explore the documentation accompanying <b>CharacterEnvironmentalQuery.</b><a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/ENV-QUERY/PUBLIC-METHODS/set-active-collider.html">SetActiveCollider</a>,
                which offers more details on the usage and functionality.

        <h2>Q: How do I begin implementing the provided systems via code?</h2>
        <ul class="answer-division">
            <li class="answer-li">

            </li>
            <li class="answer-li">
                To begin, create a new controller class inheriting from <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/humanoid-controller.html">HumanoidController</a>.
                This grants access to all implemented locomotion mechanics, depending on which optional components are attached to your character object. For combat, ensure your character
                object also has the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/CHARACTER-COMBAT/character-combat.html">CharacterCombat</a> component attached. Consult the documentation
                for each of the other provided classes to identify public properties for creating features like UI-tracked cooldowns or integrating custom code.

        <h2>Q: How can I make a charge attack release immediately upon key release, bypassing the need for a draw animation cycle?</h2>
        <ul class="answer-division">
            <li class="answer-li">
                <b>A:</b>
            </li>
            <li class="answer-li">
                By default, the code for executing a charged attack verifies whether the animation cycle is finished before permitting the
                attack to be released. However, if you're utilizing solely a charging animation without a corresponding draw animation,
                this verification process will cause a delay in releasing the attack, which might be an unwanted behaviour in this context.
                To bypass this delay, you can create a draw animation consisting of only one frame. This way, the animation check completes
                immediately, and upon key release, the attack will be promptly executed.
