        <h2>Q: Why does the character need 2 colliders in order to function properly?</h2>
        <ul class="answer-division">
            <li class="answer-li">
                <b>A:</b>
            </li>
            <li class="answer-li">
                The character requires two colliders for optimal functionality, due to how the mechanics implemented in the Locomotion System.
                One collider <b>(Vertical)</b> is dedicated to the character's <b>main body collision detection</b>, while the second collider <b>(Horizontal)</b>
                is specifically utilized for the <b>floor slide mechanic</b>. The system dynamically toggles between these two colliders as needed, ensuring that
                each one is active only when required. This dynamic switching allows for precise control over collision detection, enabling the character to seamlessly
                interact with the environment. 
                <br>
                For more insight, explore the documentation accompanying <b>CharacterEnvironmentalQuery.</b><a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/ENV-QUERY/PUBLIC-METHODS/set-active-collider.html">SetActiveCollider</a>,
                which offers more details on the usage and functionality.

        <h2>Q: How do I begin implementing the provided systems via code?</h2>

                <b>A:</b>
            </li>
            <li class="answer-li">
                To begin, create a new controller class inheriting from <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/humanoid-controller.html">HumanoidController</a>.
                This grants access to all implemented locomotion mechanics, depending on which optional components are attached to your character object. For combat, ensure your character
                object also has the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/CHARACTER-COMBAT/character-combat.html">CharacterCombat</a> component attached. Consult the documentation
                for each of the other provided classes to identify public properties for creating features like UI-tracked cooldowns or integrating custom code.

        <h2>Q: When I use collision callbacks to access the HumanoidController, Unity can't find the component and throws an error. How can I fix this?</h2>
        <ul class="answer-division">
            <li class="answer-li">
                <b>A:</b>
            </li>
            <li class="answer-li">
                The root character object doesn't have colliders attached; the asset uses separate colliders in child objects. To access the HumanoidController class in your collision
                callback, use <b>collision.transform.root.GetComponent&lt;HumanoidController&gt;();</b> instead of <b>collision.GetComponent&lt;HumanoidController&gt;();</b>. This ensures
                you're referencing the <b>root</b> object containing the HumanoidController component.

        <h2>Q: Why is my character not facing the direction they are moving towards?</h2>

                <b>A:</b>
            </li>
            <li class="answer-li">
                If your character isn't facing the right direction while moving, it's likely because you're only utilizing the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-METHODS/change-horizontal-velocity.html">ChangeHorizontalVelocity</a>
                method. Remember, this method controls movement behaviour, <b>not visuals</b>. To ensure your character faces the correct direction, be sure to also utilize the
                <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-METHODS/flip-character.html">FlipCharacter</a> method.

        <h2>Q: My charge attack doesn't release immediately if I release the key right after pressing it. Can I fix this?</h2>
        <ul class="answer-division">
            <li class="answer-li">
                <b>A:</b>
            </li>
            <li class="answer-li">
                Yes, you can fix this. By default, the code for executing a charged attack checks whether the animation cycle is complete before releasing
                the attack. If your attack only has a charge animation without a corresponding draw animation, this check can cause a delay, which might
                be an unwanted behaviour in this context. To bypass this, create a draw animation consisting of a single frame from the charge animation.
                This will make the animation check complete immediately, ensuring the attack is released promptly when you release the key.
            </li>

        <h2>Q: My charge attack gets stuck in the last frame of its animation when it's released. How can I fix this?</h2>

                <b>A:</b>
            </li>
            <li class="answer-li">
                When creating a new attack (<a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/ATTACK-SO/attack-so.html">AttackSO</a>), whether it's configured
                as chargeable or not, you need to reference an animation clip to the "<b>AttackAnimation</b>" field. This clip is used by the combat system to determine when the attack has been completed.
                If the attack is made chargeable, two additional fields are provided for referencing animation clips. One is for the animation clip when the attack is initiated (<b>optional</b>),
                and the other is for when the attack is charging (<b>required</b>). Make sure your attack configuration includes references to all essential animation clips.

        <h2>Q: Can I create a combo attack that includes a charge attack mid-combo?</h2>

            <li class="answer-li">
                Unfortunately, the combat system within the asset <b>does not support</b> charge attacks in a combo sequence. Combo attacks can only consist of normal attacks.
