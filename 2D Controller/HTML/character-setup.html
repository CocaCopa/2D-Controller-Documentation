        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Importing the CharacterTemplate Prefab:</b>
                <br>
                Begin by importing the CharacterTemplate prefab from the provided <a class="redirect-link" href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> folder.
                <b>Drag and drop</b> this prefab into your Unity scene to initiate setup.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Assigning the Default Character Sprite:</b>
                <br>
                Navigate to the SpriteRenderer component within the <b>CharacterTemplate</b> in your scene. This component can be found under <b>CharacterTemplate -> Animatable -> SpriteHolder -> Sprites</b>.
                Here, select and reference your desired character sprite to serve as the default appearance of your character. You can also scale the <b>Sprites</b> object if you wish to change
                the size of your character but <b>NOT</b> the <b>SpriteHolder</b>.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Aligning Colliders:</b>
                <br>
                Ensure that your selected sprite aligns properly with the character's colliders. You can find the colliders under <b>CharacterTemplate -> Animatable -> Colliders -> Horizontal / Vertical</b>.
                Specifically, focus on the <b>Vertical</b> collider as it should have no offset set in the X axis to ensure proper alignment. The <b>Horizontal</b> collider, on the other hand,
                generally does not require any special adjustment for alignment, but you may still review it for optimal positioning if needed.
                <br>
                <b>Vertical Collider:</b> Will be used when your character is in an <b>upright position</b>.
                <br>
                <b>Horizontal Collider:</b> Will be used when your character is <b>floor-sliding</b>.
                <br>
                The colliders of the character will be automatically toggled by the <b>HumanoidController.</b><a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-METHODS/try-floor-slide.html">TryFloorSlide</a> method.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Layers & Tags:</b>
                <br>
                Assign your character to the desired <b>Layer</b> and/or <b>Tag</b>. By default, the assigned layer is set to <b>Ignore Raycast</b> since the asset cannot be destributed with
                custom layers included.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Creating and Attaching a Custom Controller:</b>
                <br>
                Create a new class that inherits from the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/humanoid-controller.html">HumanoidController</a> class.
                Attach this new custom controller to the root object of your character <b>(CharacterTemplate)</b>. This will allow you to extend and customize the character's behaviour
                as needed. Once the controller script is created and attached to the character, it will attempt to reference the colliders of the character to their respective fields.
                If the provided prefab is altered in any way, this operation might fail and the script will throw an error; otherwise a message will be logged in the console indicating
                that the operation was successful.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Saving Your Character Prefab:</b>
                <br>
                After configuring your character object, save it as an <b>original prefab</b>. This prefab will act as the base character object for your project.

        <h2 id="character-animations-setup">Character Animations Setup</h2>
        <p>
            Once you've prepared your character object, navigate to the <a class="redirect-link" href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> folder again, and
            locate the <b>CharacterTemplate</b> animator controller. It's recommended to create a duplicate of this animator controller instead of directly editing
            it, for easier management and to avoid accidental changes.
            <br><br>
            To integrate your preferred animations with the animator controller template, simply assign your desired animation clip to each animation state
            within the controller. If you wish to exclude a particular animation state, it's recommended to leave the state's reference empty rather than removing
            it altogether. This helps prevent <b>errors</b> or <b>unintended</b> behaviour.
            <br><br>
            <b>Some Notes:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The system supports both <b>double-jump</b> and <b>wall-jump</b> animations. If your character jumps while in the air or performs a wall jump, the animator will
                transition to the respective state. If you lack distinct animations for double jumping and/or wall jumping but intend to <b>support these mechanics</b>, do not
                leave these fields empty; instead, reference your normal jump animation.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                At this stage, <b>none</b> of your animations will function. If you press play in the editor, your character will remain stationary, displaying the default sprite set in
                the Sprite Renderer component. This issue will be resolved in the next section of <b>this</b> page.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Important:</b> Ensure that you reference the newly created animator controller to the animator component field of your character object. You
            can find this field within the character object under <b>CharacterTemplate -> Animatable</b>.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 id="character-animations-setup-single-jump-animation">Character Animations Setup - Single Jump Animation</h2>
        <p>
            The locomotion system and animator are designed to support a series of animations for jumping via a blend tree, including <b>jump-rise</b>, <b>jump-mid</b>, and <b>jump-fall</b>
            phases, resulting in the setup of the jump animation being a bit tricky. To configure it, <b>double-click</b> the '<b>BlendTree_OnAir</b>' animation state to open the blend
            tree settings. From there, you can assign the three animations that make up your jump sequence. The blend tree is pre-configured with default threshold values that should work
            well with any combination of animations.
            <br><br>
            <b style="color: red;">Important:</b> If you only have a <b>single</b> animation for jumping, you can use the same animation for all three fields in the blend tree. Removing any of the three animation
            references may cause unwanted behaviour.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Reference your animations from top to bottom: <b>Jump-Fall -> Jump-Mid (Transition to fall) -> Jump-Rise</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <img class="img-large" src="../IMAGES/_CHARACTER-SETUP/JumpBlendTree.png" alt="JumpSetup">
        <br>
        <h2 id="character-animations-setup-wall-slide-animation">Character Animations Setup - Wall Slide Animation</h2>
        <p>
            The <b>Wall Slide</b> animation may need some adjustments to appear visually correct. Ensure that when your character is wall sliding,
            it is properly positioned against the wall. If not, you'll need to adjust your animation clip slightly.
            A common solution is to <b>animate</b> the "<b>Sprites</b>" child object of the <b>CharacterTemplate</b> along with the wall slide
            animation clip. This can be found under <b>CharacterTemplate -> Animatable -> SpriteHolder -> Sprites</b>. Move it slightly backward
            once the animation begins. For reference, you can inspect how the wall-slide animation clip of the provided player character is set up.
            <br><br>
            There is no need to fix any potential offsets right now since the character isn't yet configured to move or perform any actions. It is
            recommended to complete this documentation page first. You can then address any offsets when you reach the <b>Locomotion System</b> page,
            where all the mechanics will be implemented.
        </p>
        <br>
        <img class="img-large" src="../IMAGES/_CHARACTER-SETUP/WallSlideAnim.png" alt="WallSlideAnim">
        <br>
        <h2 id="character-animations-setup-ledge-grab-climb-animation">Character Animations Setup - Ledge Grab/Climb Animation</h2>
        <p>
            The ledge grab and climb animations may be offset by a significant margin due to the ledge detection method. To ensure accurate animations, the character's
            visuals (not the character object's position) will be adjusted to match the detected ledge's height and horizontal position. This adjustment occurs whenever
            a ledge is detected and the character engages in a grab or climb. The visual offset resets immediately after the action is completed. You can set this offset
            using the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/CHARACTER-LEDGE-GRAB/character-ledge-grab.html">LedgeGrab</a> component attached to your character,
            which includes a preset value to assist with initial adjustments.
            <br><br>
            As with the wall-slide mechanic, there is no need to rush and fix any offsets at this time. You can address any offsets when you reach the <b>Locomotion System</b>
            page, where all the mechanics will be implemented.
        </p>

        <h2 id="animation-clips-rebind">Animation Clips Rebind</h2>
        <p>
            By default, Unity expects an <b>Animator</b> component to be attached to the same object as a <b>Sprite Renderer</b> component. This setup allows animation clips to play
            correctly without additional configuration. However, in this case, the Animator component <b>is not</b> on the same object as the Sprite Renderer. Therefore, the animation clips'
            paths need to be updated to reflect this change.
            <br><br>
            To ensure the <b>Animator</b> component <b>correctly</b> locates the <b>Sprite Renderer</b> in the hierarchy, follow these steps using the <b>provided tool</b> for changing animation
            clip paths:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <b><li>Backup Animation Clips:</li></b>
            Make sure to first backup your animation clips of your character.
            <br><br>
            <b><li>Select Character Object:</li></b>
            Select your character in the hierarchy window.
            <br><br>
            <b><li>Rebind the Animation Clips:</li></b>
            With the character selected, head over to <b>Tools -> Rebind Animator Sprites</b> in the top menu.
            <br>
            <b style="color: red;">Important:</b> Remember to <b>re-run</b> the tool whenever you add <b>new</b> animation clips to the Animator.
        </ul>
        <p>
            With this setup, you will be able to animate other parts of your character, such as the character collider, alongside the main character animations.
        </p>
