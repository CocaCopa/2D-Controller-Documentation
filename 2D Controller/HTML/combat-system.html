        </div>
        <h2 id="normal-single-creating-and-configuring-attacks">Creating and Configuring the Attack</h2>
        <p>
            To utilize the combat system, first and foremost, an attack needs to be created. For details on how to create a new attack, please refer to
            the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/ATTACK-SO/attack-so.html">AttackSO</a> documentation. Once the attack is created, let's configure
            it to function as a gun fire. This configuration requires a corresponding <b>animation clip</b> for the attack, a prefab to act as the <b>bullet projectile</b>
            and an empty <b>GameObject</b> to serve as the reference spawn point for the bullet to be fired from.
            <br><br>
            Let's begin by configuring the created attack. Pay attention to the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>AttackPushesCharacter:</b>
                <br>
                Configure the attack so that each time the character attacks, they are pushed backward slightly, adding a polished touch.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>WallCastDistance:</b>
                <br>
                Prevent the character from initiating the attack if they are too close to a wall by configuring this property. This helps
                prevent the bullet from phasing through walls.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>ThrowAtPercentage:</b>
                <br>
                Configure this property so that the projectile is thrown at the specified percentage of the animation played. This ensures
                that the projectile matches the animation motion and is not thrown immediately when the attack key is pressed.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Cooldown:</b>
                <br>
                Ensure that the cooldown set in the configuration matches or is longer than the duration of the attack animation clip to
                prevent <b>errors</b> or <b>unintended behaviour</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Review the image below for a visual example of the attack configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the attack now configured, the next step is to set up the projectile that will be thrown. Follow these steps to create a reference
            spawn point for the bullet:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Create a New Empty GameObject:</b>
                <br>
                In the Unity Hierarchy, right-click on the character object to which the projectile spawn point will be attached.
                <br>
                Select <b>Create Empty</b> to add a new empty GameObject as a child of the character object.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Position the Spawn Point:</b>
                <br>
                Rename the new empty GameObject to something like 'BulletSpawnPoint' for clarity.
                <br>
                Position this GameObject at the location on the character from where the projectile should be fired.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> To make positioning easier, temporarily change the default character's sprite to the frame of the animation where
            the bullet will be fired. This provides a visual reference for accurate placement.
        </p>

                <b>Adding the Animation Clip</b>
                <br>
                Drag and drop the attack animation clip into the animator. This should be the same attack animation referenced in the AttackSO attack.

            <li>
                <b>Creating State Transitions</b>
                <br>
                Make a transition from the attack animation state to the <b>Exit</b> state of the animator.
                <br>
                Configure the transition with no exit time or transition duration.
                <br>
                Set the transition condition to trigger only when the animator variable "<b>IsAttacking</b>" is <b>false</b>.

                <b>References</b>
                <br>
                Begin by creating two fields to reference the <b>AttackSO</b> attack and the <b>spawn point</b> for the bullet projectile.

            <li>
                <b>Triggering the Attack</b>
                <br>
                As this attack is not configured as a chargeable attack, it is considered a <b>Normal</b> attack. With that in mind, let's call
                the appropriate function (<a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/CHARACTER-COMBAT/PUBLIC-METHODS/perform-normal-attack.html">PerformNormalAttack</a>)
                when the <b>'X' key</b> is pressed on the keyboard to allow the character to perform the attack.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div id="normal-combo-attack" class="combat-title">
            <span>Normal Combo Attack - No Projectile</span>
        </div>
        <h2 id="normal-combo-creating-and-configuring-attacks">Creating and Configuring the Attacks</h2>
        <p>
            Similarly to the '<b>Single Normal Attack</b>' the first step is to create the attacks (<a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/ATTACK-SO/attack-so.html">AttackSO</a>)
            that will form the combo sequence. This involves configuring each attack to your liking until you achieve the desired result.
            <br><br>
            Let's cofigure configure the attacks for the combo sequence. Pay attention to the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>AdjustPositionOnAttackEnd:</b>
                <br>
                Some animations may cause the character to move slightly, resulting in an offset from their pivot position. If the character moves forward during the animation,
                they will teleport back to their pivot position when the animation ends. This property addresses that issue by teleporting the character to a specified offset
                as soon as the animation completes, ensuring a seamless transition. To understand how this property works, try removing the set offset of the attack and observe
                the effect in action.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Cooldown:</b>
                <br>
                You'll notice that the cooldown for the fourth attack is different from the others. The system allows for varying cooldowns for each attack in a combo sequence.
                For example, if your combo sequence consists of four attacks, each attack can have a different cooldown which will affect the cooldown of the combo attack depending
                on which attack the character stopped attacking.
                <br><br>
                In this configuration, if the character stops after the first, second, or third attack, the cooldown of the combo attack will be <b>0.5 seconds</b>. However, if the character
                completes the entire combo sequence, the cooldown of the combo attack will be <b>1.5 seconds</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <li>

                <br>
                Drag and drop each attack animation clip into the animator. The animation clips should be the same with those referenced in each of the AttackSO attacks.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Creating State Transitions</b>
                <br>
                Make a transition from each attack animation state to the <b>Exit</b> state of the animator.
                <br>
                Configure each transition with no exit time or transition duration.
