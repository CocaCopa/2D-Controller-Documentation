        </div>
        <h2 id="normal-single-creating-and-configuring-attacks">Creating and Configuring the Attack</h2>
        <p>
            To utilize the combat system, first and foremost, an attack needs to be created. For details on how to create a new attack, please refer to
            the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/ATTACK-SO/attack-so.html">AttackSO</a> documentation. Once the attack is created, let's configure
            it to function as a gun fire. 
            This configuration requires the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Animation clip</b> for the attack.</li>
            <li>A prefab to act as the <b>bullet projectile</b>.</li>
            <li>An empty <b>GameObject</b> to serve as the reference spawn point for the bullet to be fired from.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Let's begin by configuring the created attack. Pay attention to the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>AttackPushesCharacter:</b>
                <br>
                Configure the attack so that each time the character attacks, they are pushed backward slightly, adding a polished touch.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>WallCastDistance:</b>
                <br>
                Prevent the character from initiating the attack if they are too close to a wall by configuring this property. This helps
                prevent the bullet from phasing through walls.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>ThrowAtPercentage:</b>
                <br>
                Configure this property so that the projectile is thrown at the specified percentage of the animation played. This ensures
                that the projectile matches the animation motion and is not thrown immediately when the attack key is pressed.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Cooldown:</b>
                <br>
                Ensure that the cooldown set in the configuration matches or is longer than the duration of the attack animation clip to
                prevent <b>errors</b> or <b>unintended behaviour</b>.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>DamageAmount:</b>
                <br>
                Note that the damage amount set for the attack is 0, as the attack itself won't directly cause damage. Instead, the thrown projectile
                will inflict damage. Therefore, we need to configure the projectile separately. This includes defining its velocity and the damage amount
                it can inflict to other objects. On the other hand, the <b>layers</b> that can be damaged will be configured within the AttackSO by adjusting
                the '<b>DamageableLayers</b>' property.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Review the image below for a visual example of the attack configuration.

                <b>Adding the Animation Clip</b>
                <br>
                Drag and drop the attack animation clip into the animator. This should be the same attack animation referenced in the AttackSO attack.

            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Creating State Transitions</b>
                <br>
                Make a transition from the attack animation state to the <b>Exit</b> state of the animator.
                <br>
                Configure the transition with no exit time or transition duration.
                <br>
                Set the transition condition to trigger only when the animator variable "<b>IsAttacking</b>" is <b>false</b>.

            <b style="color: red;">Important:</b> Prior to proceeding, ensure that you have configured the projectile for the attack by referring to the <a class="redirect-link" href="#projectile-setup">Projectile Setup</a> section. 
            <br>
            With the attack now fully set up, we can proceed to implement it through code.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>References</b>
                <br>
                Begin by creating two fields to reference the <b>AttackSO</b> attack and the <b>spawn point</b> for the bullet projectile.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Triggering the Attack</b>
                <br>
                As this attack is not configured as a chargeable attack, it is considered a <b>Normal</b> attack. With that in mind, let's call
                the appropriate function (<a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/CHARACTER-COMBAT/PUBLIC-METHODS/perform-normal-attack.html">PerformNormalAttack</a>)
                when the <b>'X' key</b> is pressed on the keyboard to allow the character to perform the attack.

        <div id="normal-combo-attack" class="combat-title">
            <span>Normal Combo Attack - No Projectile</span>
        </div>
        <h2 id="normal-combo-creating-and-configuring-attacks">Creating and Configuring the Attacks</h2>
        <p>
            Similarly to the '<b>Single Normal Attack</b>' the first step is to create the attacks (<a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/ATTACK-SO/attack-so.html">AttackSO</a>)
            that will form the combo sequence. This involves configuring each attack to your liking until you achieve the desired result.
            <br><br>
            Let's cofigure the attacks for the combo sequence. Pay attention to the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>AdjustPositionOnAttackEnd:</b>
                <br>
                Some animations may cause the character to move slightly, resulting in an offset from their pivot position. If the character moves forward during the animation,
                they will teleport back to their pivot position when the animation ends. This property addresses that issue by teleporting the character to a specified offset
                as soon as the animation completes, ensuring a seamless transition. To understand how this property works, try removing the set offset of the attack and observe
                the effect in action.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Cooldown:</b>
                <br>
                You'll notice that the cooldown for the fourth attack is different from the others. The system allows for varying cooldowns for each attack in a combo sequence.
                For example, if your combo sequence consists of four attacks, each attack can have a different cooldown which will affect the cooldown of the combo attack depending
                on which attack the character stopped attacking.
                <br><br>
                In this configuration, if the character stops after the first, second, or third attack, the cooldown of the combo attack will be <b>0.5 seconds</b>. However, if the character
                completes the entire combo sequence, the cooldown of the combo attack will be <b>1.5 seconds</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Creating State Transitions</b>
                <br>
                Make a transition from each attack animation state to the <b>Exit</b> state of the animator.

                Configure each transition with no exit time or transition duration.
                <br>
                Set each transition condition to trigger only when the animator variable "<b>IsAttacking</b>" is <b>false</b>.

        <p>
            In order for the attack to inflict damage to other objects, we will need to setup its hitbox. Some information regarding the hitbox:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Hitbox GameObject</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>The hitbox is an empty game object and is a child of the game object with the SpriteRenderer component.</li>
                    <li>You can find it under <b>CharacterTemplate -> SpriteHolder -> Sprites -> AttackHitbox.</b></li>
                    <li><b style="color: red;">Important:</b> Do not remove or change its position in the hierarchy, as it may affect its functionality.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Hitbox Damage</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Damage is inflicted by the combat system only when the <b>AttackHitbox</b> GameObject is <b>active</b> in the hierarchy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To align the hitbox with each attack:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Select the Sprites game object (located under <b>CharacterTemplate -> SpriteHolder -> Sprites</b>).</li>
                            <li>In the animation window, choose the attack animation you want to configure.</li>
                            <li><b>For each frame of the attack</b>, animate the position and scale of the hitbox to match your preferences.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Visualizing the Hitbox</b>
                <br>
                To see the attack hitbox during gameplay:
                <ul>
                    <li>Check the <b>'VisualizeHitbox'</b> property within the CharacterCombat component.</li>
                    <li>When <b>disabled</b>, the hitbox will have an outline (<b>no damage</b> inflicted).</li>
                    <li>When <b>enabled</b>, the hitbox will fill with color (damageable objects <b>will take damage</b>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In brief, align your hitbox animation with the attack motion. This step requires fine-tuning to suit your preferences. Consider adding duplicate
            frames to allow more movement for the attack hitbox. For reference, explore how the <b>ComboAttack01</b>, <b>SwordAttack</b>, <b>ComboAttack03</b>,
            and <b>ComboAttack04</b> animations are configured, under <b>2D Character Controller -> Visuals -> DeadRevolver
            -> Animations</b>.

                <br>
                The AttackAnimation is essential for both normal and chargeable attacks. However, it's easy to overlook referencing it specifically in a chargeable attack
                configuration. Be sure to associate the correct animation clip with the AttackAnimation property. Failing to do so will result in the combat system being
                unable to identify when the attack has been completed, potentially causing the attack to get stuck on the last frame of its animation.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>InitiateChargeAnimation (Optional)</b>
                <br>
                If your attack involves an initiation animation just before transitioning into the charge loop, you can specify it in this field. However,
                some attacks may not have such an animation. If your attack <b>lacks</b> an initiation phase, you can leave this field <b>empty</b>.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>ChargeAnimation</b>
                <br>
                The charge animation represents the phase where your character prepares their charge attack. During this time, the character holds the attack and continuously
                loops the charge animation. The duration of this animation is determined by the rest of the AttackSO configuration. As long as the configuration allows it,
                your character will remain in the charged state, ready to release their attack.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>ScalableProjectileDamage</b>
                <br>
                Now that the attack is configured as chargeable, you have the option to enable scalable damage. When you toggle this property to true, the combat system
                <b>dynamically</b> adjusts the damage amount of the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/COMBAT-SYSTEM-PROJECTILE/combat-system-projectile.html">CombatSystemProjectile</a>
                component of the projectile object, based on how long the attack was charged.
                <br>
                Charging the attack for a <b>shorter duration</b> results in <b>less damage</b>, while a <b>longer charge</b> yields more <b>impactful damage</b>.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>ScalableProjectileVelocity</b>
                <br>
                Similar to the ScalableProjectileDamage property, you now have the option to enable scalable velocity for your projectiles. When you set this property to true,
                the system dynamically adjusts the velocity based on how long the projectile was charged. A shorter charge results in lower velocity, while a longer charge yields
                a faster and more impactful velocity.
            </li>

        <h2 id="charge-animator-setup">Animator Setup</h2>
        <p>
            Setting up the animator for a charge attack requires some fine-tuning. However, the process follows the same logic as for previously created attacks. Let's get started:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Adding the Animation Clips</b>
                <br>
                Drag and drop each animation clip into the animator. In this case we will need:
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Initiate Animation (Optional)</b>
                        <br>
                        Represents the start of the charge attack.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Charge Animation</b>
                        <br>
                        The charge phase during which the animation will loop.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Release Animation</b>
                        <br>
                        The release phase, where the projectile is thrown and the attack deals damage.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Creating State Transitions</b>
                <br>
                Pay close attention when configuring the transitions between animation states. Incorrect configuration may lead to unexpected behaviour.
                <br>
                For reference, check out the "<b>CharacterExample</b>" animator located in the <b>2D Character Controller -> Visuals -> Animators</b>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Create a prefab:</b>
                <br>
                Begin by creating a new prefab. To this prefab, attach the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/COMBAT-SYSTEM-PROJECTILE/combat-system-projectile.html">CombatSystemProjectile</a>
                component. This component enables you to tailor the projectile's characteristics such as damage and velocity.

            <li>
                <b>Projectile hitbox</b>
                <br>
                Subsequently, create an empty game object within the prefab. This object serves as the hitbox area for the projectile. Any entity intersecting
                with this area sustains damage.
                <br>
                <b style="color: red;">Important:</b> Remember to reference the hitbox's transform to the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/COMBAT-SYSTEM-PROJECTILE/combat-system-projectile.html">CombatSystemProjectile</a>

                <b>Configuration</b>
                <br>
                Fine-tune the projectile's behaviour by adjusting the parameters within the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/COMBAT-SYSTEM-PROJECTILE/combat-system-projectile.html">CombatSystemProjectile</a>
                and <a class="redirect-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Rigidbody2D.html">Rigidbody2D</a> components. Here, you can specify the desired damage amount and velocity to tailor the projectile's impact,
                as well as the gravity scale and other physics related parameters.

                In the Unity Hierarchy, right-click on the character object to which the projectile spawn point will be attached.
                <br>
                Select <b>Create Empty</b> to add a new empty GameObject as a child of the character object.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Position the Spawn Point:</b>
                <br>
                Rename the new empty GameObject to something like 'BulletSpawnPoint' for clarity.
                <br>
                Position this GameObject at the location on the character from where the projectile should be fired.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> To make positioning easier, temporarily change the default character's sprite to the frame of the animation where
            the bullet will be fired. This provides a visual reference for accurate placement.
