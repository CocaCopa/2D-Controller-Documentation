        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, we will explore how to implement all the locomotion mechanics provided in the asset. By the end, we will have a
            functional character capable of performing the following actions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Smooth Movement</li>
            <li>Jump</li>
            <li>Dash</li>
            <li>Wall / Floor Slide</li>
            <li>Ledge Grab / Climb</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Before we proceed, let's set up our character. If you haven't completed this step yet, please visit the <a class="redirect-link" href="character-setup.html">Character Setup</a>
            section first.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="project-settings">Project Settings - Anti-jitter</h2>
        <p>
            The asset utilizes the <a class="redirect-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html">Rigidbody2D</a> component, but for a smoother experience, the physics simulation is coded in the <a class="redirect-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Update.html">Update</a>
            method instead of the <a class="redirect-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html">FixedUpdate</a> method. To prevent jittering when the character moves, you should change the simulation
            mode of the physics engine in the Project Settings. This adjustment will ensure that the code executes smoothly.
            <br>
            To change the physics simulation mode follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <b><li>Open Project Settings:</li></b>
            Go to <b>Edit -> Project Settings</b> in the top menu.
            <br><br>
            <b><li>Navigate to Physics Settings:</li></b>
            In the Project Settings window, select <b>Physics 2D</b> from the left-hand menu.
            <br><br>
            <b><li>Change Simulation Mode:</li></b>
            Find the <b>Simulation</b> Mode setting and change it to <b>Update</b> to match the Update method's frame rate.
        </ul>
        <p>
            Making this change will help synchronize the physics simulation with the frame rate, ensuring smoother character movement and avoiding jittering issues.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2 id="horizontal-movement">Horizontal Movement</h2>
        <p>
            To implement horizontal movement for your character, simply call the  <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-METHODS/change-horizontal-velocity.html">ChangeHorizontalVelocity</a>
            method of the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/humanoid-controller.html">HumanoidController</a> class and pass as the parameter the horizontal
            input as a Vector2 variable.
            <br><br>
            <b>Note:</b> When obtaining the horizontal input from the keyboard, it is preferable to call the <a class="redirect-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxisRaw.html">GetAxisRaw</a>
            method instead of <a class="redirect-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html">GetAxis</a>, as the latter can make the movement laggy. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <img class="img-large" src="../IMAGES/_LOCOMOTION-SYSTEM/HorizontalMovement.png" alt="HorizontalMovement">

        <br>
        <h2 id="character-orientation">Character Orientation</h2>
        <p>
            To make sure our character faces the right direction while moving we also need to utilize the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-METHODS/flip-character.html">FlipCharacter</a>
            function. As a parameter we simply need to pass the horizontal input.
        </p>
        <br>
        <img class="img-large" src="../IMAGES/_LOCOMOTION-SYSTEM/CharacterOrientation.png" alt="CharacterOrientation">

        <br>
        <h2 id="character-jump">Jump</h2>
        <p>
            The locomotion system already performs the appropriate checks to determine whether the character should be allowed to perform a jump.
            <br>
            These checks include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Character is grounded.</li>
            <li>Character is in mid-air and has remaining air jumps.</li>
            <li>Character is not currently dashing.</li>
            <li>Coyote Time (a grace period after leaving a platform).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Therefore, we don't need to add any further checks in our custom code. To implement the jump mechanic, we simply need to call the
            <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-METHODS/try-jumping.html">TryJumping</a> method when
            the desired key is pressed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <img class="img-large" src="../IMAGES/_LOCOMOTION-SYSTEM/CharacterJump.png" alt="CharacterJump">

        <br>
        <h2 id="character-dash">Dash</h2>
        <p>
            The implementation of the dash mechanic focuses on enhancing responsiveness rather than just executing the action.
            Upon the designated key press, the game will conduct a pre-dash check for potential collisions with the character's
            head or feet. If a collision is detected, the character's position is dynamically adjusted based on parameters configured
            within the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/CHARACTER-DASH/character-dash.html">CharacterDash</a> component
            in the inspector.
            <br><br>
            To integrate the dash mechanic, simply call the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-METHODS/try-dashing.html">TryDashing</a>
            method when the desired key is pressed.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2 id="wall-slide">Wall Slide</h2>
        <p>
            The wall slide mechanic can be implemented in two different ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Immediate Wall Slide:</b>
                <br>
                As soon as a wall is detected and the character is not grounded, wall slide will immediately be initiated.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Conditional Wall Slide:</b>
                <br>
                The character will only be able to slide down a wall if a specific condition is met, such as a keypress from the keyboard.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For this example, we will implement a conditional wall slide. The goal is to allow the character to wall slide only if they are
            running towards the wall.
            <br>
            Simply call the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-METHODS/wall-slide.html">WallSlide</a> method,
            passing as the parameter your desired condition.
            <br><br>
            <b>Note:</b> Keep an eye on the created <b>'RunTowardsWall'</b> function as it will be utilized again later on.
        </p>
        <br>
        <img class="img-large" src="../IMAGES/_LOCOMOTION-SYSTEM/WallSlide.png" alt="WallSlide">

        <br>
        <h2 id="floor-slide">Floor Slide</h2>
        <p>
            The floor slide mechanic allows the character to slide along the ground when a specific condition is met, most commonly
            a keypress. In this case, the character will slide when the Down Arrow key is held on the keyboard. Note that the method
            used is <a class="redirect-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetKey.html">GetKey</a> and <b>not</b>
            <a class="redirect-link" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetKeyDown.html">GetKeyDown</a>.
            <br><br>
            An important aspect of this mechanic is that the locomotion system will continue the slide if the keypress is lifted while the character is under a collider that cannot be fit under. This prevents the character from getting stuck.
            <br><br>
            To implement this mechanic, simply call the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-METHODS/try-floor-slide.html">TryFloorSlide</a> method, passing the keyboard input as the parameter.
        </p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h2 id="ledge-grab">Ledge Grab</h2>
        <p>
            The ledge grab mechanic will allow your character to grab onto a ledge and can be implemented in two different ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Immediate Ledge Grab:</b>
                <br>
                As soon as a ledge is detected and the character is not grounded, ledge grab will immediately be initiated.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Conditional Ledge Grab:</b>
                <br>
                The character will only be able to grab a ledge if a specific condition is met.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When implementing the ledge grab mechanic, it is crucial to ensure the <b>correct order</b> of method calls to prevent unintended behaviour,
            such as the jump not being performed. To address this issue, the <b>jump</b> mechanic should be implemented <b>after</b> the <b>ledge grab</b>
            method. This sequence allows for the character to smoothly transition from grabbing a ledge to executing a jump when the appropriate input is
            provided.
            <br><br>
            In the example below, we will implement a conditional ledge grab. We will require the player to provide
            horizontal input towards the wall in order to execute the action. To achieve this, simply call the
            <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-METHODS/ledge-grab.html">LedgeGrab</a>
            method and pass the <b>RunTowardsWall</b> function, which was previously created, as a parameter.
        </p>
        <br>
        <img class="img-large" src="../IMAGES/_LOCOMOTION-SYSTEM/LedgeGrab.png" alt="LedgeGrab">

        <br>
        <h2 id="ledge-climb">Ledge Climb</h2>
        <p>
            The ledge grab mechanic will allow your character to climb a ledge and can be also implemented in two different ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Immediate Ledge Climb:</b>
                <br>
                As soon as a ledge is detected and the character is not grounded, ledge climb will immediately be initiated.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Conditional Ledge Climb:</b>
                <br>
                The character will only be able to climb a ledge if a specific condition is met.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Let's make the ledge climb mechanic conditional. In this example, when the character is grabbing a ledge, pressing the Space key on the
            keyboard will initiate the ledge climb. However, since the Space key is already used by the jump mechanic, pressing Space to climb will
            cause the character to <b>jitter</b>. This happens because the character will attempt to climb and jump simultaneously.
            <br><br>
            To resolve this issue, we need to make a minor <b>adjustment</b> to the implementation of the <b>jump mechanic</b>. Specifically, we should
            check if the character is grabbing a ledge before allowing the jump mechanic to activate.
            <br><br>
            Let's implement this by simply calling the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-METHODS/ledge-climb.html">LedgeClimb</a>
            method, passing the <b>Space-bar keypress</b> as a parameter, and <b>modifying</b> the 'if' statement of the <b>jump mechanic</b> to also check if the
            '<a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/PUBLIC-PROPERTIES/is-ledge-grabbing.html">IsLedgeGrabbing</a>' property of the
            <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/HUMANOID-CONTROLLER/humanoid-controller.html">HumanoidController</a> is <b>false</b>.
        </p>
