        <p>
            The collision queries in the asset are handled by the <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/MANUAL/ENV-QUERY/env-query.html">CharacterEnvironmentalQuery</a>
            component. It provides the locomotion and combat systems with essential information about the environment surrounding the character. This information allows
            these systems to determine how the character can behave in the environment. Consequently, the configuration of this component significantly influences the
            behaviour logic of these systems. <b>Fine-tuning the component needs time and patience.</b> The <b>default</b> values can work well with characters that are
            that are approximately <b>1.64</b> Unity units <b>tall</b> and <b>0.72</b> Unity units <b>wide</b>.
        </p>

            Although the component comes <b>pre-configured</b> within the CharacterTemplate prefab and the provided characters within the asset, it's beneficial to understand
            how it's set up. For proper functionality, it needs the following references:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Ledge Grab Transform:</b>
                <br>
                This should be an empty GameObject, a child of the root object with the component attached. It helps the component identify the preferred position relative
                to the character for searching a ledge, which is crucial for the Ledge Grab/Climb mechanics.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Head/Chest/Feet Transforms:</b>
                <br>
                These should also be empty GameObjects, children of the root object with the component attached. They determine the positions of the respective parts of
                the character. By correctly positioning these transforms, the CharacterEnvironmentalQuery will produce more accurate results.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By correctly positioning these transforms, the CharacterEnvironmentalQuery will produce more accurate results.

        <h2 id="setup-collision-layers">Setting up the Component - Collision Layers</h2>
        <p>
            The component allows you to specify which layers the queries should interact with. You have two options for setting the layers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Use Specified Layer</b>
                <br>
                This option lets you pick the layers that the component will consider.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Exclude Character</b>
                <br>
                With this option, the component will perform casts against all layers except the one the character is set to.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Based on your selected setup, the component will conduct its checks only within the specified layers. This will affect how the mechanics
            as well as the systems within the asset operate.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>
        <p>
            When the component queries the environment, it takes into account the character's <a class="redirect-link" href="CLASSES/SCRIPTING/ENV-QUERY/PUBLIC-METHODS/set-active-collider.html">active collider</a>.
            This allows the component to remain independent of the character's size, ensuring it works with any size with the same precision. All "<b>size</b>" properties in the inspector represent a percentage based on
            the collider's size and position.
            <br><br>
            For instance, setting a "<b>Size Y</b>" value to <b>0.5f</b> means the cast size will be <b>50%</b> of the character's active <b>collider size</b>. This ensures
            consistency in queries even if the character's collider size is changed later after fine-tuning the component's values.
            <br><br>
            In contrast, <b>distances</b> are calculated in units, as expected. For example, if you set a "<b>Distance</b>" value to <b>1.0f</b>, the cast will be <b>1</b> Unity <b>unit away</b>
            from the character.
            <br><br>
            You can always visualize the casts through the "<b>Debug</b>" section of the component for better clarity and troubleshooting.
